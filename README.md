# Dimensionality Reduction of Hand Movements Using Alternating Minimization
This repository proposes an alternating minimization method for extracting **kinematic synergies** from joint angular velocity profiles of human hand movements. 
# What are Kinematic Synergies?
Kinematic synergies are coordinated, low-dimensional movements across multiple joints. Researchers hypothesize that the central nervous system (CNS) uses these synergies to handle complex and high-dimensional hand movements with ease.
